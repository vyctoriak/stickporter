## 🧩 How it works

- **Sticker.ly packs:**  
  The bot uses Puppeteer to scrape sticker images from Sticker.ly pack links. It downloads the PNGs, resizes them to 512x512, and uploads them as a new Telegram sticker set.
- **Telegram sticker API:**  
  Uses the latest Telegram API for sticker set creation, supporting emoji lists and static format.
- **Session:**  
  Uses grammY's session middleware to track user state between steps (title, emoji selection, etc).

---

## 🐞 Troubleshooting

- **Bot says "can't parse stickers JSON object" or "invalid user_id specified":**  
  Make sure you are using the latest version of `grammy` and `@grammyjs/files`, and that you are using the correct API call format (see code).
- **Bot says "Não consegui encontrar stickers nesse pack":**  
  The Sticker.ly link may be invalid, private, or the pack is not available for scraping.
- **Bot does not respond:**  
  Make sure your bot token is correct and the bot is running.
